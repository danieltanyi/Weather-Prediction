Data Analysis Overview / Real Time Machine Learning Projects


Data analysis course covers a range of topics, including advanced Excel, SQL, Python, machine learning, and Power BI. The course begins with an introduction to data analysis, followed by advanced Excel techniques, such as working with large datasets, creating PivotTables and PivotCharts, and using advanced functions. Next, I learn about SQL, including querying and joining databases.
