Data Analysis Overview / Real Time Machine Learning Projects


Data analysis course covers a range of topics, including advanced Excel, SQL, Python, machine learning, and Power BI. The course begins with an introduction to data analysis, followed by advanced Excel techniques, such as working with large datasets, creating PivotTables and PivotCharts, and using advanced functions. Next, I learn about SQL, including querying and joining databases.


After that, I am introduced to Python and machine learning, where I learn how to use Python for data analysis, build and evaluate predictive models, and work with algorithms such as linear regression and decision trees.
